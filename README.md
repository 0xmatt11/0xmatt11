Welcome to my **current GitHub account** — this is where all new projects and updates will live going forward.

### ⚠️ Important Note
I previously used another GitHub account, but I’ve **lost access** to it.  
For transparency, you can view my old profile here:

👉 [Old GitHub Account — @0xmatt1](https://github.com/0xmatt1)

That account is now inactive and will no longer receive updates.  
If you’re looking to confirm that this is the legitimate successor, you can cross-reference project histories, code styles, and commit patterns — everything continues here under my new username.
